**Notice**

As part of my personal project on Sydney housing prices, I have analyzed some interesting facts and figures related to the price and price per size (m2) of properties sold in the Greater Sydney area between 2016 and 2022.

This analysis focuses on the three main housing types, namely houses, townhouses, and apartments/units/flats, to understand the trends and changes in price and price per size for each type over the given period.
